# by user specific and project specific confgurations, or a configuration file

# "warning", "error" and "fatal".  SELint will report all errors at or above
# the selected level

# Check enabling works as follows each step may override the one prior:
# 1. All checks at or above the set severity level are enabled by default
# 2. Checks may be disabled using the "disable" option below
# 3. Checks may be enabled in either normal or source modes using the "enable_normal" and "enable_source" options below
# 4. Checks may be disabled on the command line using the -d option
# 5. Checks may be enabled on the command line using the -e option

# Uncomment and modify to disable selected checks.  This can be overridden on
# the command line
