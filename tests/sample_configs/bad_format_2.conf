# This is the configuration file for SELint.  The global configuration file
# is the default if no other configuration is provided, but can be overridden
# by user specific and project specific confgurations, or a configuration file
# can be provided on the command line.

# Set the severity level to report.  Options are "convention", "style",
# "warning", "error" and "fatal".  SELint will report all errors at or above
# the selected level
severity = "convention" = 43

# Check enabling works as follows each step may override the one prior:
# 1. All checks at or above the set severity level are enabled by default
# 2. Checks may be disabled using the "disable" option below
# 3. Checks may be enabled in either normal or source modes using the "enable_normal" and "enable_source" options below
# 4. Checks may be disabled on the command line using the -d option
# 5. Checks may be enabled on the command line using the -e option

# Uncomment and modify to disable selected checks.  This can be overridden on
# the command line
disable = { E-003, E-004 }

enable_source = { E-003 }

# Modules.conf location.  If you are running SELint in "source mode", you need
# to supply a modules.conf file in order to run all checks.  SELint will look
# in the default location of policy/modules.conf from the directory where it
# is run.  To use a different path specify it here.
