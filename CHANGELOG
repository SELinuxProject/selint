# SELint Changelog

## Unreleased
### Added (general features)
- -S flag to print a summary of issue found following an analysis
- --context flag to specify additional files to parse but not scan.
  This is primarily helpful if you want to only scan your modified files
  in a full source repository.  (If you are planning on loading your local
  modules into your already installed policy and have local development
  headers in a standard location, selint should find them by default and you
  don't need to use this option)
- -F flag to return an error code on issues found

### Added (checks)
- C-005 for permission ordering
- S-003 for unneeded semicolons
- S-004 for template calls from interfaces
- S-005 for declarations in an interface
- S-006 for the use of a bare module statement instead of policy_module() macro
- S-007 for the use of a gen_context() macro with no mls component specified
- S-008 for gen_require() macro calls with unquoted arguments
- W-006 for interface call with empty arguments
- W-007 for unexpected spaces in interface arguments
- W-008 for permission lists with * or ~
- W-009 for module name not matching file name
- E-006 for declaration/interface name clash
