# SELint Changelog

## Unreleased
### Added (general feature)
- -S flag to print a summary of issue found following an analysis
- --context flag to specify additional files to parse but not scan.
  This is primarily helpful if you want to only scan your modified files
  in a full source repository.  (If you are planning on loading your local
  modules into your already installed policy and have local development
  headers in a standard location, selint should find them by default and you
  don't need to use this option)
- -F flag to return an error code on issues found

### Added (checks)
- S-003 for unneeded semicolons
- E-006 for attribute/interface name clash

### Changed
- Turn C-001 off by default.
- Assume the presence of system_u user and object_r role if no config is loaded.
